# 🐶 Oh Ye Thats me - Wongta

👋Hi, I'm an adorable doggo named Wongta. My parents have turned me into an **NFT** collection, aiming to capture my various styles and quirky looks. To be honest, I don't quite grasp what these adults are thinking every day. They seem to find joy in amusing themselves with me, and I can feel their💓love for me. Even though I can't speak, I can still hear them chattering about recording me on the next generation of the internet.

For this purpose, my dear mom has designed a variety of unique🌈colorful skins and fashionable 👓 accessories for me, symbolizing my distinctive personality and story. Some of these skins even boast vibrant colors, paired with meticulously crafted accessories, making me look a bit sassy. 😵‍💫Opps, that older one among them always insists on showcasing my unique charm, and though I'm somewhat reluctant, I secretly enjoy it🤪.

🌭They say this way, many people will probably adore me, allowing more of their friends to get to know me and have me. Each and every 'me' is truly one-of-a-kind, carrying love and happiness. I may not entirely understand this "NFT" thing😴, but I do realize I've become a special presence, as if stepping into a magical world. What I truly sense is the boundless affection from these kind adults. While I can't express it in words, I feel it in my heart, responding with smiles and wagging my tail, conveying my most genuine emotions to them.
